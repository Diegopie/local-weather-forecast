# Weather Forecast

This is a weather forecast application that allows users to search any city in the US to find the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index, and 5 day forecast. The application will automatically save a user's 10 recent searches.

## Objective

- Build and style a dynamic web page
- Allow users to search for any US city and be presented with relevant weather information
- Save the user's search history on the page, but only store valid city names
- Let users click on the recent search to get that data displayed again, but not have more than 10 items saved in their search history

## Outcome

This weather application was a great way to practice working with APIs. It took my some time to get APIs wrapped around my head and this project was a great way to get comfortable with them. There are more complexities to APIs that i'd like to explore, and my CSS skills definitely need some polish, but I am happy with the results and am eager to apply what I've learned.

## Collaborators

A very special thank you to the Bootstrap, Moment JS, and OpenWeather teams for making this application possible.
